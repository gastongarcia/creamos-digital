# The Reality of AI and Marketing: What AI Systems Can and Cannot Actually Do

## Introduction

Over the past few weeks, I've been researching how artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants interact with brand and marketing information. What I've discovered directly contradicts much of what AI "experts" and YouTubers are promoting. This post summarizes what I've learned directly from Claude (an AI assistant from Anthropic) about the fundamental limitations of these systems and what it means for our digital marketing strategies.

## The Uncomfortable Truth: AI Doesn't Automatically Learn From Your New Content

The most important revelation you need to understand is this: **current AI systems do not automatically update their knowledge base with new content you publish online**.

Unlike search engines that continuously crawl and index the web, large language models (LLMs) like those powering ChatGPT and Claude have:

**Knowledge cutoff dates** - Claude, for example, has data only up to October 2024, while GPT-4o has a cutoff date of October 2023 (though it can search the web). Anything published after these dates simply doesn't exist in their knowledge base.

**Distinction between knowledge base and web search** - It's important to distinguish between knowledge embedded in the model (limited to its cutoff date) and the ability of some models to perform real-time searches. Models like GPT-4o can access updated information during a specific conversation, but they don't permanently incorporate that information into their knowledge base for future queries.

**No automatic updates** - Publishing a new product, updating technical specifications, or launching a marketing campaign does NOT automatically update what these systems "know" about your company.

**No individual learning capacity** - Even if a user informs the AI about your latest product during a conversation, that knowledge isn't retained for future conversations with other users.

## Why This Matters

This has enormous implications for digital marketing:

- All your SEO, content optimization, and traditional marketing strategies **do not directly affect what AI systems know about your company**.
- AIs might provide outdated or incomplete information about your products and services, even if you've published updates on your website.
- As more consumers use AI assistants to research products, this disconnect becomes a significant problem for brand information accuracy.

## Real Options for Businesses

There are four main paths for businesses:

### 1. Corporate Agreements with AI Giants (High Cost)

Some major corporations are establishing direct relationships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies to ensure their updated information is incorporated into future model updates. This typically requires:

- Significant financial investments
- Established business relationships
- Dedicated technical teams
- Substantial leadership time

This option is typically out of reach for all but the largest companies.

### 2. Create Your Own AI Assistant for Your Company (Medium-High Cost)

Developing specialized AI assistants that are specifically trained on your updated content. This involves:

- Development of custom systems
- Knowledge bases focused on your products and services
- Considerable internal or contracted technical expertise

### 3. Connect AI with Your Corporate Database (Medium Cost)

This is an approach where an AI system is directly connected to your databases and updated documentation. When users ask questions, the system first consults your proprietary information before generating a response.

This requires technical implementation but is becoming more accessible.

### 4. Make It Easy for Users to Share Your Information (Low Cost)

The most practical option for most businesses:

- Create exceptionally clear, well-organized, and accessible content
- Make it easy for users to find and share your accurate information
- Anticipate common questions and structure content to answer them directly
- Make information easy to reference and share in AI conversations

**Specific structuring techniques:**

- Organize information in a frequently asked questions (FAQs) format
- Create concise summaries at the beginning of lengthy sections
- Use clear, descriptive headings that answer specific questions
- Include technical specifications in easy-to-copy tabular formats
- Implement structured data (Schema.org) to help systems that combine search and AI

The typical workflow would be:

1. A user asks an AI assistant about products like ours
2. The AI provides general information based on its training
3. If the user wants specific details, they might search our website
4. They find our well-organized information
5. They share that information with the AI in their conversation
6. Only then can the AI incorporate our specific information into its responses

## It's Not SEO, But There Are Connections: A New Paradigm

Unlike traditional SEO, there currently isn't a direct equivalent of "AI optimization" that automatically improves how your company appears in AI responses. However, there are important nuances to consider:

**The convergence of search and AI** - Google, Bing, and other search engines are incorporating generative AI into their results. This means well-structured content remains relevant, as AI-powered search engines can use it as a reference in generated responses.

**Technical data structuring** - Techniques like implementing JSON-LD, Schema.org, and other forms of structured data can help search engines with AI components extract information more accurately.

**Direct questions and answers** - Organizing content in a question-and-answer format can make it more likely that the information will be retrieved by systems that combine search and AI generation.

This shift represents an evolution, not a complete abandonment of existing digital strategies. Businesses need to adapt their current approaches while developing new strategies specific to the AI era.

## Conclusion

The reality is that the knowledge base in current AI systems is established during training and is not automatically updated with new content you publish online. While some models can access recent information through web searches, they don't retain this information for future conversations.

For most businesses, the most practical short-term strategy is to make content exceptionally clear, well-structured, and easy to find. This allows both direct users and systems that combine search and AI (like new versions of Google and Bing) to access and effectively use your updated information.

In the medium term, keeping an eye on emerging data structuring techniques and optimization for AI systems will become increasingly important, especially as traditional search engines and generative AI continue to converge.

It's crucial that our marketing and technical teams understand these limitations and opportunities to develop effective strategies in a landscape where AI systems play an increasingly important role in how consumers find and evaluate products and services.
